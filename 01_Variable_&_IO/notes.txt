📌 What is a Variable?
A variable is used to store a value in memory.
It is like a container that holds data which can change during program execution.

Example:

int age = 20;
String name = "Muditya";
Here, age and name are variables storing integer and string values.

📌 What is I/O in Java?
I/O stands for Input and Output:

Input → Taking data from the user (keyboard)
Output → Showing the result to the user (screen)

Example:

import java.util.Scanner;

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);       // Input
int num = sc.nextInt();
System.out.println("You entered: " + num); // Output

📌 What is Type Casting?
Type casting means converting one data type into another.

There are two types of type casting:

1️⃣ Widening Casting (Implicit):
Small type → Larger type (no data loss)
Java does it automatically.

Example:

int a = 10;
float b = a; // int to float

2️⃣ Narrowing Casting (Explicit):
Large type → Smaller type (data may be lost)
You have to do it manually.

Example:

float x = 9.8f;
int y = (int) x; // float to int → value becomes 9

🧠 Extra Tip:
Always use explicit casting carefully, as data can get cut off or rounded.
