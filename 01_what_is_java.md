# 📘 What is Java?

Java is a **high-level**, **object-oriented**, **class-based**, and **platform-independent** programming language developed by **James Gosling** at Sun Microsystems in **1995**.

It is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible and is one of the most popular languages used today — running on more than **3 billion devices** worldwide.

## ✅ Key Points About Java

- Java is a **general-purpose** programming language.
- It is **object-oriented** (follows the concept of classes & objects).
- Java code is written once and runs anywhere (WORA).
- Used in **web apps**, **mobile apps (Android)**, **enterprise software**, **games**, **IoT**, and more.

## 🚀 Features of Java

| Feature             | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **1. Simple**        | Easy to learn syntax similar to C/C++ but no complexities like pointers. |
| **2. Object-Oriented** | Everything in Java is an object (except primitives). |
| **3. Platform-Independent** | Write once, run anywhere — compiled Java code runs on any OS using JVM. |
| **4. Secure**        | Java has a secure runtime environment (e.g., no pointer, bytecode verification). |
| **5. Robust**        | Strong memory management, exception handling, and garbage collection. |
| **6. Multithreaded** | Supports multithreading for parallel execution. |
| **7. High Performance** | Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler improves performance. |
| **8. Distributed**   | Java can build distributed applications using RMI and EJB. |
| **9. Portable**      | Code can run on any machine with JVM. |
| **10. Dynamic**      | Java can adapt to evolving environments and supports runtime class loading. |

## 📌 Fun Fact:
Java was originally called **Oak**, later renamed to Java (inspired by Java coffee 🍵).

## 🔚 Summary

Java is everywhere — from Android phones to bank servers.  
Learning Java builds strong programming fundamentals and opens doors to **backend development**, **DSA preparation**, **Spring Boot projects**, and **job-ready skills**.
